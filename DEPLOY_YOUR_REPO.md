## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Build Failed?

**Check the deploy log** in Netlify for errors.

Common issues:
```bash
# Test locally first:
cd frontend
npm install
npm run build

# If that works, the issue is with Netlify config
```

### Site Shows Blank Page?

1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Check **Console** tab for errors
3. Check **Network** tab for failed requests

### API Calls Not Working?

Check:
1. Is `VITE_API_URL` set in Netlify?
2. Is your Railway backend running?
3. Test backend: `curl https://your-backend.railway.app/api/health`

### 404 on Page Refresh?

Already fixed! ✅ Your `netlify.toml` handles this.
