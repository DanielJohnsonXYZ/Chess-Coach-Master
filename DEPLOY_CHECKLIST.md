## Troubleshooting

### If frontend doesn't load:
1. Check Netlify deploy logs
2. Verify build completed successfully
3. Check browser console for errors

### If API calls fail:
1. Verify `VITE_API_URL` is set in Netlify
2. Test backend URL directly
3. Check CORS settings
4. Verify backend is running

### If coach chat doesn't work:
1. Check Railway logs for errors
2. Verify `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set correctly
3. Check API key has credits/permissions
4. Test backend `/api/chat` endpoint with curl
